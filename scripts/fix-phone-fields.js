// Script to fix phone field issues in client code

// We've already updated:
// 1. firebase.ts - Added phone to internData type and ensuring it's sent in createInternAccount
// 2. internService.ts - Added triple-check to ensure phone field is present before saving to Firestore
// 3. routes.ts - Added check to ensure phone field is present in request
// 4. manage-interns.tsx - Added logs for debugging phone field issues
// 5. consoleUtils.ts - Added utility to fix missing phone fields

// For any other locations that might be using interns, we should make sure to:
// 1. Ensure phone field is included in data structures
// 2. Use proper logging to track any issues

Phone Field Fix Script

Issues addressed:
- Updated firebase.ts to ensure phone field is included in intern data
- Added triple-check in internService.ts to ensure phone field is never missing
- Added server-side validation in routes.ts
- Added debug logging throughout the app
- Added console utility to fix missing phone fields

For existing interns with missing phone fields, use:
await window.fixPhoneFields();

For new interns, the phone field will now be properly required and saved.
